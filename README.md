# ðŸ§  Emotion Analysis of Conversations

This project is a Streamlit-based web app that performs **emotion classification** on conversational text using the pre-trained transformer model [`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The app takes a multi-turn conversation as input (e.g., dialogue between people) and identifies the **emotional tone of each sentence or utterance**. It also visualizes emotional trends across the conversation using bar charts and emotion timelines.
